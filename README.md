# About this template

Use this template to create a starting point for a site generated by Hugo.  If running within VS Code or an online Codespace, a devcontainer will be setup automatically with the latest version Hugo and other useful extensions pre-installed.

Based off Microsoft's [template](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/master/containers/hugo).

## Getting started

1. Create a repo based on this template
2. After cloning your new repo, open as a container in VS Code
3. Initialize your site by running `hugo new site . --force`
