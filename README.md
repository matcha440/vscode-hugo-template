# About this template

Use this template to create a starting point for a site generated by Hugo.  If running within VS Code or an online Codespace, a devcontainer will be setup automatically with the latest version Hugo and other useful extensions pre-installed.

## Getting started

1. Create a repo based on this template
2. After cloning your new repo, open as a container in VS Code
3. Initialize your site by running `hugo new site . --force`

## Upgrading the version of Hugo

You can either rebuild the container, or within a terminal shell to the container just rerun `./scripts/install-hugo.sh`.

## Pinning Hugo to a specific version

If you want to use a specific version of Hugo instead of the latest, just specify it in `containerEnv.HUGO_VERSION` in the `devcontainer.json` file and rebuild your container.
